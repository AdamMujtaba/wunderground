# wunderground
python script that calls wunderground API to get a yearly Temperature update. 

This script is useful for those who wants to get a csv file (you can open it in Microsoft Excel and do your job) at the same time you need to pay attention for the JSON scrapping. you can add new columns and raws for it, such as exact time, city, or any thing related you can get in the API 

its pretty fun to get this kind of info. try it. 

before running the script make sure you have registered in Wunderground website and you have your keys.
